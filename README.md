# Spatial-Reconstruction-of-Wave-Dynamics-in-the-Bay-of-Bengal
This project focuses on CNN-based spatial reconstruction of significant wave height in the Bay of Bengal using sparse observations. It uses over 40 years of open-source wave data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store and was developed for research purposes at CSIR–National Institute of Oceanography, India.
